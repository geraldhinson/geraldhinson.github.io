(NOTE: if you are seeing this 'NOTE' this website is still under heavy construction.)

This personal website coughed to life like a neglected V8 engine for several reasons. 

Partly to provide a place to write biz/tech posts longer than LinkedIn allows. Partly as a forward link destination from other sites that vary greatly in terms of format & content supported.

But, mostly to be a <b>single location for <sup>(1)</sup>ruminations on the topics that matter most to me (and perhaps to you?). Things like: <b>faith, family, technology, guitar, coffee, sailing, writing</b>, and, of course, the (successful) pursuit of the <b>perfect biscuit!</b> My life thus far has been an endless fixation on the things in that list. 

But, as the title above implies, I am still learning.

That said, if you find of interest:

- My thoughts on building great software
- Studies and stories from my life that explain my unapologetic faith in God/Jesus (and why you should join me in that)
- How an Arkansas land-lubber becomes a sailboat enthusiast

OR

If you likewise find occasion to build <b>back-end services</b>, you may be here for <b>Siftd</b> - the <em>(WARNING: adjective abuse ahead)</em> open-source, data-center agnostic, <b>journaled-microservice</b> framework for building simple backends that scale. 

Regardless, poke around a bit.

You are welcome here.

<sup>(1) Ruminations - high-dollar word meaning 'to chew the cud'. Moo!</sup>

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
